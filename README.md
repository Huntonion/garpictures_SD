# Garpictures

Forked from my own project, [Garpictures](https://github.com/Huntonion/Garpictures), for the Software Dependability class project. It is an ecommerce website for stock images.
The objective of this project is to adapt software dependability practices to it, such as building it in CI/CD, quality analysis, migration on Docker, code coverage analysis, testing, etc.
